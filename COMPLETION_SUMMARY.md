## 🚀 Next Steps for User

1. **Configure NFS Mounts**: Edit `nfs-mounts.conf` and run `./mount-nfs.sh mount`
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure `PLEX_TOKEN` and other service tokens
3. **Deploy System**: Run `./lib/just/just deploy`
4. **Access Services**: Use .danger domains for all services
5. **Monitor System**: Use `just monitor` and `just logs` for health checks
