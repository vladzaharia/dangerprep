Use WebAwesome components whenever possible. You can find the documentation directly at https://webawesome.com/. Do NOT use Context7 or any other tools for WebAwesome documentation as it changes rapidly. 

You can find components (like card, input, etc) at https://webawesome.com/docs/components/{component name, all lowercase, separated by dashes} like https://webawesome.com/docs/components/animated-image and https://webawesome.com/docs/components/avatar

You can find layout primitives (like stack, grid, cluster, etc) at https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/{primitive name, all lowercase, separated by dashes} like https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/cluster or https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/align-items

Color utilities are found at https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/color and should be used whenever possible

Use WebAwesome classes, components, utilities, layouts, etc whenever possible. Only roll your own if absolutely necessary.
